# mlg_final_project
This is my final project for the Machine Learning Graz course on Data Science!
#
Actually, this is my first-ever project here on Github, and also my first try at a proper data science project.
#
This project will consist of two parts: in the first part, I will describe the dataset and answer 5 questions/hypotheses about the data. 
#
In the second part, I will use some simple machine learning techniques to build a classification model.
#
I hope you enjoy it!
